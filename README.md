# E-Commerce-App
This app demonstrates the back end of a E-Commerce Site.

Given data from an E-Commerce site, this app will allow you to see all of the products, categories and tags.  You are also able to create a new category/product/tag through a post route, update a category/product/tag through a put route and delete a category/product/tag through a delete route.  The only way to test it is through Insomnia.  The below video shows all of the details.
